# Packet Analyzer

## Summary

Quick PCAP/CAP analyzer I made in an evening. Prints out HTTP Requests and shows stats on:
- Sites
- HTTP Methods
- User Agents
- IP Addresses
- GeoIP of IP Addresses

Also allows you to ignore specific file extensions(images, css, etc) to filter noise. Sample PCAP file included. Happy hacking!

### Usage
`python packetanalyzer.py sample.pcap`
